    I primarily use <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a> when developing Java applications. I have years of experience with Spring, and it can do a lot for you without much effort. It’s often described as working automagically. This is code for “I don’t know why it worked, but it worked.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Spring just makes things work. You worry about your “business logic” code and Spring will glue everything together. But sometimes this breaks down. Spring will assume and try to do <em>too</em> much.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spring lets you define “beans” in a configuration class that can be injected into other services. You define how to create an instance of a class once and it’s then automatically injected into other services that need it.
    <code class="code-block">
      @Configuration
      class LoggingConfiguration {
          @Bean
          LoggingService loggingService() {
              return new LoggingService();
          }
      }
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is great. Spring will create one instance of <code>LoggingService</code> and will give you a reference every time you need one. But you can also define beans that use built in Java types such as <code>String</code>, <code>List</code>, or <code>Map</code>.
    <code class="code-block">
      @Bean
      Map&lt;String, String&gt; loggingProperties() {
          Map&lt;String, String&gt; properties = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
          properties.put("debug.enabled", "true");
          return properties;
      }
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    And this usually does what you want. You define a service that uses this bean and Spring figures out want you want from the variable name (<code>loggingProperties</code>) and the type (<code>Map&lt;String, String&gt;</code>).
    <code class="code-block">
      @Component
      class LoggingService {
          private final Map&lt;String, String&gt; loggingProperties;

          LoggingService(Map&lt;String, String&gt; loggingProperties) {
              this.loggingProperties = loggingProperties;
          }
      }
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    But what happens if you make a mistake? What happens if you don’t match the variable name exactly to the bean name?
    <code class="code-block">
      LoggingService(Map&lt;String, String&gt; <b>loggingProps</b>) {...}
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    You are asking for a bean that is not explicitly defined. I’d hope the application would fail to start; fail fast to avoid a bug. Nope, Spring tries to be smart. It tries to find <em>something</em> that could satisfy that bean requirement, and sometimes, it succeeds.
  </p>
  <p>
  One of Spring’s automagic features is to provide a collection of all beans of a given type. If you want all <code>LoggingService</code> beans, you can use either of these:
  <code class="code-block">
    List&lt;LoggingService&gt; services;
    Map&lt;String, LoggingService&gt; services
  </code>
  and Spring will populate those collections for you. The map keys are populated with the name of the bean.
  </p>
  <p>
    So let’s say you mistype your variable name. And you happen to have <em>any</em> String beans defined such as:
    <code class="code-block">
    @Bean
    String selectAll() {
        return "select * from table_name";
    }
  </code>
    Spring will give you a map of all beans of type String. It won’t fail to start. And it definitely won’t give you your explicitly defined <code>loggingProperties</code> bean.
  <p>
  <p>
    This automagic feature is something I’ve used myself. Sometimes it’s really useful to get all beans of a given type. I don’t mind that the feature is there. I mind that it’s too easy to get it wrong and cause bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    My recommended fix: don’t define beans using the provided types such as <code>String</code>, <code>List</code>, or <code>Map</code>. Don’t give Spring the chance to guess. Define a custom type and explicitly ask for that type. If you just need a map, that’s okay. Extend HashMap to create your custom type and use that.
    <code class="code-block">
      class LoggingProperties extends HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; {...}
    </code>
    And use this type in your bean definition:
    <code class="code-block">
      @Bean
      LoggingProperties loggingProperties() {
        LoggingProperties properties = new LoggingProperties();
            properties.put("debug.enabled", "true");
            return properties;
      }
    </code>
    Now if you mistype a variable name, Spring won’t have a bean to give you and the application won’t start. This is such a better failure mode. Instead of silently giving you what you don’t want, Spring refuses to run. I wish Spring had pulled back its automagic just a bit for this one and defined its own custom types for this feature. But it did not, so we must code defensively for it.
